# adventofcode2021
My responses for the Advent of Code 2021 https://adventofcode.com/2021

Note that this is just for fun. I am not optimizing all the solutions, I am testing extra things etc. I am just trying to find the solutions to the problems relatively fast (in implementation time, not processing time)

The repo is structured for me to be able to use it for multiple programming languages if I would feel like it :)

## Languages

 - [Python](./python/README.md)
