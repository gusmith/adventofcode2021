# Advent of code 2021 - Python

This folder contains a python package `src` containing one package per day plus some utilities.

Each "day" package should have a corresponding `day{x}.py` module which contains the main method.
They are mainly implemented as independent scripts, printing out the result.

## Install

Use a virtual environment of your choice and have `poetry` install.
Then
```shell
poetry install
```
It will install all the required dependencies, including the one for formatting, linting and testing (some plenty of dev ones).
